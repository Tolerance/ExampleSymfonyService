# Tolerance Example Symfony Service

This is an example application that is used for demos of real-life usage of [Tolerance](http://tolerance.io) features.

## Getting started with Docker

You can simply use the Docker image:
```
docker run -d sroze/tolerance-example-symfony-service
```

## Manually

Well, that's a classic [Symfony application](http://symfony.com/doc/current/quick_tour/the_big_picture.html) :)
